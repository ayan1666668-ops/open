## Runner registration budget

OpenClaw's current GitHub runner-registration bucket reports 10,000 self-hosted
runner registrations per 5 minutes in `gh api rate_limit`. Re-check
`actions_runner_registration` before each tuning pass because GitHub can change
this bucket. The limit is shared by all Blacksmith runner registrations in the
`openclaw` organization, so adding another Blacksmith installation does not add
a new bucket.

Treat Blacksmith labels as the scarce resource for burst control. Jobs that
only route, notify, summarize, select shards, or run short CodeQL scans should
stay on GitHub-hosted runners unless they have measured Blacksmith-specific
needs. Any new Blacksmith matrix, larger `max-parallel`, or high-frequency
workflow must show its worst-case registration count and keep the org-level
target below about 60% of the live bucket. With the current 10,000-registration
bucket, that means a 6,000-registration operating target, leaving headroom for
concurrent repositories, retries, and burst overlap.

The protected cache warmer has two platform rows: the existing Linux workload and one hosted macOS pnpm-store publisher. Its per-ref concurrency and pending-run coalescing are unchanged. Each admitted warmer run adds one hosted macOS job and no Blacksmith registrations; pull-request CI adds no writers or jobs. Native producer and consumer measurements must include cache transfer, extraction, installation, and archive size before claiming a setup-time saving.

The published-upgrade PR/main tripwire reuses the reserved `docker-seed-e2e` job,
so the retained peak envelope stays `4 × 144 + 21 × 200 = 4,776` registrations.
Docs-only main tips remain excluded by the `**/*.md` and `docs/**` push filters.
Admitted main pushes retain the same two non-canceling parity slots; the bound
includes both active runs and both coalesced successors. It does not assume
that every pushed commit starts a run.
The weekly Update Migration dispatch uses one targeted Docker group per
supported baseline for native operator state and keeps synthetic cleanup on
the candidate-relative predecessor. If that predecessor is outside the
supported set, it adds one existing matrix row: at most five targeted jobs,
plus image preparation, the group planner, and the hybrid ref validator, for
at most eight Blacksmith registrations per weekly run. Its separate non-canceling concurrency group
coalesces pending scheduled runs and cannot cancel manual validation. Release
checks reuse the same bounded grouping and unchanged 32-job cap: at four
distinct baselines, normal Package Acceptance selects 16 targeted jobs (17
when the predecessor needs its own row) and release soak selects 20. The
three-scenario group limit and 32-job concurrency cap are unchanged. The additional weekly burst and expanded release jobs
share the existing headroom for releases, adjacent repositories, and carryover;
the live shared bucket must still be checked before further fanout changes.

The three Mac Node parts add two hosted jobs per run on `github` and `hybrid`, with no added Blacksmith registrations there. Normal Blacksmith routing adds two registrations per qualifying attempt-1 push or trusted PR; manual runs, retries, and untrusted PRs remain hosted. The matrix concurrency cap is three. GitHub's documented Enterprise macOS concurrency allowance is 50, shared with other hosted Mac workflows; it does not guarantee immediate runner admission. No runner class or repository capacity setting changes with this split.

`Release npm Cache Warm` (`release-npm-cache-warm.yml`) runs a hosted Linux job on scheduled and manual triggers to prepare an npm download seed from the latest published OpenClaw package with lifecycle scripts disabled. Its concurrency group is separate from push-triggered Vitest warming, so newer pushes cannot cancel a pending seed. Scheduled runs publish from `main`, so new release branches can restore that seed through GitHub's default-branch cache scope. Each seed starts empty and contains only the current baseline dependency graph. Cross-OS release checks first restore their candidate-specific cache, then a matching runtime/suite cache, then this shared seed. Only npm's content-addressed `_cacache` directory is archived; install prefixes, OpenClaw state, npm logs, and executable `npx` caches remain fresh. The producer and consumers use the same relative archive path and enable cross-OS archives. npm retains normal freshness and integrity checks and downloads missing platform-specific packages. This adds one hosted Linux job per scheduled or manual warmer run, no jobs on pushes, and no Blacksmith registrations.

Small precise PR changes use a focused Node plan. Broad, deleted or unknown changes retain compact core plus the affected plugin fallback; canonical pushes use the integration compact. Every compact planner profile is capped at 80 rows, and plugin fallback packing is capped at 50. The final canonical Node matrix also enforces 64 push rows or 120 PR rows, including precise plans. Missing changed paths, missing current planner capabilities and planner errors fail preflight instead of emitting an incomplete successful matrix. Approved historical dispatches retain their full named plans. Count every emitted matrix row and nonmatrix job, including all six Android rows despite its two-job concurrency cap.

The shared plugin catch-all, QA and provider suites use native Vitest sharding, sized from the existing 90-file envelope budget. Their complete configs still own discovery and exclusions; the counting inventory never narrows execution to the directly changed plugin. At `2f7fb353`, the catch-all has 486 counting entries and 474 effective files across six jobs, QA has 238/232 across three, and providers have 275/256 across four. Counting entries include files excluded by Vitest, so the budget is conservative. Each job retains its existing worker limits, isolation policy and per-file module cleanup.

Precise and fallback plugin envelopes share the same packing owner and a 360-second aggregate estimated budget per job, including multiple envelopes of the same config. Members retain the 8-class runner and compatible dist requirements and run one at a time; total cost bounds packing rather than a pair limit. Each envelope retains its original child process, environment, native shard arguments and include scope, including process-bounded Codex, Matrix and Telegram work. Runtime-preparing envelopes remain separate. Database-worker and Signal configs, plus envelopes containing files from the three measured long Codex envelopes, stay standalone until their timing refit lands. These guards follow config/file identity, not changing bundle ordinals: the observed jobs were `bundle-25` in [run 34978416570](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/34978416570) and [run 35046146611](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/35046146611), and `bundle-16` in [run 34959628169](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/34959628169) and [run 34998358237](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/34998358237). Co-location preserves each original file/process bound and native shard partition; a physical job may contain several such envelopes. Workers, timeouts, the 50-job cap and serial stop-on-failure behavior stay unchanged. Costs retain the larger complete-family rate from [run 33676780376](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/33676780376) and [run 33747183683](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/33747183683), rounded up per counting file without lowering prior floors. Counting inputs include the config-owned exclusions, and runtime preparation is charged separately.

Eligible Blacksmith and hybrid compact bins with multiple ordinary groups request the existing 16-class runner, execute one child process at a time, and admit 540 predicted aggregate seconds with at most 20 compatible groups. Promotion changes only the emitted runner; logical classes, readable names and prepared timing keys retain their ownership. Each child retains its previous two-worker ceiling. Initial packing separates runtime consumers from groups that need no build; the measured hybrid placement pass below can use spare ordinary capacity under its unchanged 440-second budget. Other serial bins retain their ten-group cutoff and Blacksmith 200/276-second or hybrid 210-second budgets. Exclusive jobs retain 150 seconds by default. Only complete ordinary hybrid bins of non-build CLI-process groups may use 250 seconds and share split siblings; every child must still fit 150 seconds. Groups above their existing serial cap stay alone. Blacksmith and hybrid groups without dist or preparation requirements also stay alone when their committed or measured stripe weight exceeds 300 seconds. Late runtime-placement observations remain owned by the unchanged 440-second placement pass and do not participate in this initial standalone admission. Exclusive groups, single groups, private-QA, dist descriptors and jobs with runtime preparation remain serial with their existing constraints; file splitting and stripe-family separation are unchanged. The executor's independent two-child gate still requires eight available CPUs and 24 GiB of actual memory. Inner project parallelism remains one, and commands retain their serial file policy. The primary `github` profile stays serial at 210 seconds.

Until the measured tails are refit, standalone compact owners cover doctor SQLite-memory (`agentic-commands-doctor-sessions-cron-memory`), Gateway chat (`agentic-control-plane-agent-chat`), auth (`agentic-control-plane-auth-node`), runtime state (`agentic-control-plane-runtime-state`), plugin SDK (`agentic-plugin-sdk`), and the full CLI (`agentic-cli`). The first native packing run added doctor config/state (`agentic-commands-doctor-config-state`), infrastructure storage/state (`core-runtime-infra-storage-state`), and system runtime (`core-runtime-infra-system-runtime`), bringing the explicit set to nine owners. Their ordinary generated child groups remain separate across split generations; dist and preparation-owning children retain their existing packing rules. Ordinary named tails retain the 32-class request and their existing two-worker ceiling; the full CLI retains its 16-class request. Runtime-preparing children keep their existing shared packing and placement, including the 4-class `agentic-plugin-sdk-hosted-1`. Isolation must not also shrink the hosts previously provided by their packed jobs, because that would risk worsening already-long runtimes. Only the emitted runner is promoted; logical classes, names and timing identities stay unchanged. The first five owners cover the changing `checks-node-compact-small-4` inventory in [run 35045292864](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/35045292864) and [run 35046146611](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/35046146611); the CLI took 557 seconds in [run 34501950584](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/34501950584) against a 136-second weight. In [run 35052961883](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/35052961883), the three added owners measured 388 seconds, 516/556 seconds, and 318 seconds respectively. Standalone admission prevents adding work to these tails; it does not correct their stale estimates or prove a twelve-minute upper bound.

The 2026-09-16 dry run compares the same complete inventory before and after the guarded 540/360-second change. The broad plugin example uses `scripts/lib/extension-test-plan.mts` and preserves all 85 process envelopes. Compact group counts remain 159 push/209 PR for hybrid and 151 push/179 PR for Blacksmith; dist rows remain one push/two PR.

The earlier unguarded model projected 23 push/45 PR hybrid compact rows and 33 plugin rows. Protecting the known tails removes that compact row reduction: this guarded inventory adds four compact registrations per hybrid run, while removing six plugin registrations in the broad example, for two fewer broad PR registrations overall. The reference before/after labels, including eleven ordinary non-CLI standalone rows retaining the 32-class, imply 37–69 requested vCPU-minutes less compact setup per run at the measured 35–65-second checkout/setup range, plus 28–52 for the six removed 8-class plugin jobs. This credits setup only, not test-body or wall-time savings. The original unguarded hourly forecasts of 5,490–10,195 compact and 1,480–2,748 plugin setup vCPU-minutes do not describe this guarded result. The conservative registration estimate, 80/50/64/120 caps, `max-parallel`, timeouts and executor gates stay unchanged. Native proof is the packing PR's final-head CI run: report actual per-label counts, longest 16-class duration, every job over twelve minutes, and memory/cleanup evidence before claiming the wall-time effect. A 540-second body plus 90–120 seconds of setup models 10.5–11 minutes; the initial native run below did not achieve that forecast.

Initial native evidence from [PR #149656](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/149656), [run 35052961883](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/35052961883), showed that the timing weights substantially underpredicted serial execution. The run tested initial head `8dc31be7`, with merge checkout `cbd65a61` against `c561f0d4`, and emitted 52 compact plus 38 plugin rows. It finished with a failure after 25m25s. The longest 16-class job, `checks-node-compact-small-12`, took 24m20s; nine compact jobs and one plugin job exceeded twelve minutes. Observed capacity was four CPUs and approximately 15.4 GiB, with one child at a time. Small-12's 17 children consumed 1,398 seconds against the 540-second prediction; large-3's five children consumed 892 seconds. These measurements do not prove the final guarded model's latency.

The initial run also failed a runtime-placement regression test. The correction restores the previous preparation-sharing contract by keeping late runtime observations out of initial standalone admission and exempting preparation/dist groups. The three additional ordinary tail owners above are guarded from the measured run without changing timing floors. Final-head native CI remains pending; the coordinator must verify its row counts, durations, runtime-placement test and cleanup before accepting the packing change. Neither four-CPU capacity nor fewer requested setup minutes establishes an eleven-minute result.

The `github` compact planner can place smaller ordinary groups on an already-required stronger logical runner. Each emitted job retains its strongest capacity owner, serial execution, original child processes and worker limits, the 210-second budget, and the ten-group limit. SDK and plugin runtime consumers are separated from ordinary files before packing; the SDK light project intersects shared include lists with its own inventory. Parent-derived fractional costs are rounded only at the emitted job boundary, so rounding small consumers cannot create a redundant runtime build. The shared packer can exchange groups to fill compatible capacity while rechecking complete replacements. Runtime-only hosted groups may share their strongest prerequisite within the existing 210-second serial budget; the build itself costs 160–166 seconds and is charged once per job. No-build exclusive groups keep their 150-second limit. Stranded tooling tails are sized against remaining compatible capacity before normal admission is reapplied. Exclusive, dist, oversized, and runtime-preparing bins retain their separate constraints.

Failed-job-only hybrid retries retain their original matrix and its aggregate estimates when routing to hosted Ubuntu, including the 540-second ordinary bins. They do not repack to 210 seconds. Ordinary bins remain serial and retain their two-worker child ceiling. Historical two-slot descriptors still use the existing capacity gate. Such retries can exceed the eight-minute normal-run objective; existing 60/120-minute job deadlines and watchdogs are unchanged. Requested runner labels do not establish actual CPU or memory capacity.

The final Node matrix admits longer estimated jobs first across compact and plugin descriptors. Plugin estimates reuse the extension batch cost owner, including existing process boundaries; runtime preparation is charged separately from the same prerequisite table used by compact jobs. Equal estimates and historical descriptors without estimates keep their original order. The 96-job concurrency ceiling bounds active jobs, while the manifest caps bound total admissions. In run `33449014227`, all 96 slots were occupied when the late QA job started; that dependency delay was matrix admission, not evidence of runner-registration throttling.

Other expanded serial large/small jobs admit 210 predicted seconds; eligible ordinary Blacksmith and hybrid bins admit 540 with serial execution and at most 20 compatible groups. All profiles retain the shared 80-row compact cap. The 150-second file-split and default exclusive-group budgets stay unchanged; complete non-build CLI bins alone may use the 250-second ordinary hybrid admission budget. The PR-only performance lifecycle file retains its 136-second fallback from native spans of 127.288/135.808 seconds in runs 33532741896/33545657559; canonical pushes omit that tooling family. Trusted contributor forks can use the GitHub profile on Blacksmith, so every profile participates in the same registration bound. The widest current workflow profiles retain up to 86 other potential rows (14 nonmatrix and 72 matrix), or 87 for historical targets without the UI named-project contract. Normal Blacksmith and hybrid first attempts remove six UI rows; the conservative cap-based envelope still covers the wider profiles. Excluding the four unconditionally hosted iOS rows, two hosted macOS Swift phases, and the hosted aggregate gate gives the conservative ceiling of 80 potentially eligible rows. This includes the new Control UI performance job; keep the ceiling rather than spending savings from consolidated checks. With the final Node caps, the bounds are 144 registrations per main run and 200 per PR. Two active main slots, both pending successors and the observed peak of 21 non-skipped PR arrivals give `4 × 144 + 21 × 200 = 4,776` registrations in five minutes. This leaves 1,224 within the 6,000 reference operating target for release work, adjacent repositories and carryover; it does not prove those arrivals fit. The earlier 19-arrival estimate is obsolete. Using the prior 4,826-registration reference, the bounded 2026-09-02 cohort audit counted 321 unassigned Blacksmith jobs and reserved nine auxiliary rows, giving `4,826 + 321 + 9 = 5,156` planned registrations and an 844-row allowance below that reference. Its 40 exact attempts covered 4,830 jobs; queued observations spanned 21:50:48–21:57:11 UTC and were not simultaneous. Already-assigned jobs, old approval-waiting runs, unobserved retries and unlisted organization work remain outside that cohort, so this is a conditional planning bound rather than a live organization balance. Evaluate a single PR trial using its actual emitted rows separately from the rollout model. Budget all six npm qualification jobs and the relevant full-release children; a shared-token quota response or unused bucket does not establish organization-wide usage or physical runner capacity.

`checks-ui-e2e` emits seven rows for non-frozen targets with the named-project contract on Blacksmith and hybrid first attempts: six combined Control UI shards and one browser-extension row. Both use the same Blacksmith runner class. Freshly planned GitHub-profile and frozen targets with that contract retain twelve Control UI shards plus the browser row. Missing attempt metadata also retains that wider plan. Historical targets without the contract retain four total rows on the Blacksmith planner profile or fourteen on GitHub and hybrid profiles. The 2026-09-02 inventory at `49fb9c5` contains 359 files: 329 parallel bundle consumers, three parallel self-owned files, seven serial bundle consumers, and 20 serial private source/custom-build files. Ordinary CI excludes seven real-Gateway files, leaving 352. Four native projects represent resource ownership without adding jobs or execution phases: `ui-e2e-bundled` and `ui-e2e-standalone` share group 0 with at most two workers total, then `ui-e2e-serial` and `ui-e2e-serial-standalone` share group 1 with one worker. Local throttling and explicit worker limits still apply. The shared weighted sequencer charges each file by its measured duration divided by that project's effective worker count and assigns every discovered specification once across the selected Control UI rows. The root config keeps the complete inventory visible for discovery. Serial scheduling still protects private source servers that share a Vite optimizer cache, real Gateways, and the runtime-budget measurement; test cases, deadlines, and isolation are unchanged.

Every selected project discovers Chromium. The first selected bundle-consuming project builds one private production bundle/preview and publishes its URL through Vitest's invocation-scoped root context; later consumers share it until invocation teardown. Standalone projects have no bundle setup or URL bridge, so standalone-only selections skip that build. Enabled manual proof capture uses the shared upload directory, including the MCP and Logs suites.

The dedicated real-Gateway job runs its complete selected inventory in one invocation through `test/vitest/vitest.ui-e2e-prebuilt.config.ts`. It requires a clean checkout and completed runtime, private QA, and canonical Control UI artifacts from `OPENCLAW_BUILD_PRIVATE_QA=1 pnpm build:ci-artifacts`. Source and built outputs must remain unchanged until all workers and children finish. A readiness failure stops the invocation without rebuilding or falling back to another config. Files outside the prebuilt config’s shared-reader/writer allowlist run serially first; audited fixtures with private HOME, state, ports, and cleanup then share the existing two-worker limit. The allowlist admits both invocation-preview consumers and fixtures serving canonical built UI bytes through their own prepared Gateway child. The invocation preview builds its own private output from the same source. This adds no CI jobs or shards. The ordinary local config keeps real-Gateway files serial, and frozen targets lacking the prebuilt config retain their original serial command.

The original two-worker rollout had a controlled Linux comparison covering its then-complete inventory of 14 files and 25 tests, reducing invocation elapsed time from 309.374 to 202.027 seconds. Those historical results do not measure later allowlist additions, complete CI timing, or achievement of the CI latency target.

Eligible `control-ui` rows request `blacksmith-32vcpu-ubuntu-2404`; the browser-extension row keeps the 8-vCPU request, and eligible real-Gateway jobs request the 32-class. Backend, event, contributor-trust and cache-write boundaries are unchanged, including hybrid first attempts and trusted contributor forks. In [run 33692146223](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/33692146223), the two slowest UI rows requested the 8-vCPU label but reported two CPUs; their 356/383-second test steps set the 8:20 non-Windows wall. The same run's 32-vCPU jobs reported eight CPUs. The larger request added no workers. In [run 33695337496](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/33695337496), all twelve UI rows reported eight CPUs and finished by 4:38 from workflow creation, with 102–145-second test steps. That margin supports consolidating to six rows; reduced-row timings still require native proof. Stale file weights also need the existing refit's independent-run and replacement thresholds, rather than a one-run manual adjustment.

The real-Gateway placement changes only the existing runner request, adding zero jobs or registrations. Its private artifact build may overlap exactly two canonical SDK cache misses only with at least two available CPUs and 25.5 GiB of observed remaining memory for both unchanged 12-GiB heaps and 768 MiB of native headroom each. Unknown finite-cgroup usage, smaller capacity, cache hits, or a single nonempty miss retain serial compilation. Runtime and UI publication still complete before browser readers start; browser worker limits, file inventory, and deadlines are unchanged. Standalone compiler measurements are not complete CI timings, so the full job must be validated on the selected native CI route.

The browser-extension row prepares only its native-host runtime JavaScript and assets through the existing `qaRuntime` build profile rather than rebuilding declarations and the Control UI. Both current widths remain inside the conservative registration bound. A failed-job-only retry of a six-shard plan retains those six shards. PR retries and hybrid push retries select hosted Ubuntu through live routing, so they may take longer; the existing 25-minute timeout is unchanged. A retry that reruns preflight selects twelve rows. Canonical push retries on the Blacksmith profile retain Blacksmith routing. The `max-parallel` ceiling stays 14 for historical targets without the named-project contract, which retain their previous width. Physical capacity must be checked separately from the registration bound.

The previous thirteen-serial-shard layout consumed 4,258 job-seconds in successful [run 33494931388](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/actions/runs/33494931388) on 2026-09-01, averaging 327.5 seconds per Control UI row; preflight added 39 seconds and the tail row took 363 seconds. The current projects reduce the modeled body through bounded bundled concurrency. In run `33638745824`, twelve successful first-attempt Control UI rows had median/p90 test steps of 197/235 seconds, while their checkout median reached 116.5 seconds. Reducing thirteen Control UI shards to twelve removes one repeated checkout and setup without combining the separate browser-extension work. The current target is eight minutes for normal non-Windows CI, with fewer jobs preferred over a tighter latency target. Measure queueing, checkout, setup and test work separately; the final gate still waits for Windows, which may exceed that target. The historical serial layout and the single hosted retry are not paired performance comparisons.

Canonical-repo CI keeps Blacksmith as the default runner path for pushes and first-attempt same-repo pull-request runs when the backend is unset or `blacksmith`. Hybrid keeps the heavy set plus the named critical-path plateau lanes on Blacksmith for attempt 1; other light lanes and every rerun Blacksmith lane use GitHub-hosted capacity. Pull-request retries of both UI E2E jobs use GitHub-hosted Ubuntu in every mode; push retries remain on their normal backend unless hybrid fallback applies. Manual `workflow_dispatch` and non-canonical repository runs use GitHub-hosted runners for the main test/build lanes. With an unset or `blacksmith` backend, ordinary canonical manual dispatches (`release_gate: false`) can still run the seven `check-shard` rows on their Blacksmith matrix runners; release-gate check rows remain hosted. Same-repo hybrid Full Release Validation sends only frozen-candidate lint to its matrix runner, both for exact main-ancestor SHAs without a release context and for canonical release-context candidates. These manual admissions are outside the main/PR arrival estimate above. The [`github` backend](/ci/runners#runner-backend-modes) provides a manual repository-wide fallback; canonical runs do not probe Blacksmith queue health or mutate the variable automatically.

## Measured shard weights

Complete hybrid main and pull-request plans retain their existing jobs and runner
allocations while admitting measured runtime groups within 440 seconds, including
the existing 100-second build allowance. This reserves 40 seconds of the
eight-minute objective for checkout/setup; it does not change test deadlines or
guarantee elapsed time. Only non-exclusive jobs without dist or private-QA
preparation participate. A whole runtime group can move to an already-required
equal-or-stronger runner only with its own explicit worker limit.

The recipient can already prepare a runtime or have spare ordinary capacity. An
ordinary recipient remains serial and prepares one runtime; its ordinary
groups retain their two-worker allowance through explicit pins. Their
prepared timing identities remain unchanged, preserving complete parent
generations. The CI executor applies the smaller of the supplied
job ceiling and group cap. When transfers have the same maximum estimate, the
planner prefers the recipient with more remaining time. This can add a runtime
build while reusing spare ordinary capacity, without adding a job or
runner registration. Count that preparation cost when verifying the result.

Both replacement bins must pass the shared family, group-count and budget
checks. If no transfer fits, CI retains the complete existing plan and reports
its over-budget estimate; an optimization cannot suppress test coverage.
Recipient capacity must preserve the donor job's fixed runner anchor, including
any earlier promotion of that group. Exclusive, private-QA, dist and hosted
policies remain unchanged. Precise changed-file plans retain their original
placement templates and admission floors.

The refit stores typed runtime-placement observations from the emitted group
descriptor, successful complete envelope and runtime-readiness marker. Configs,
group environment, complete file membership and prebuild mode accompany each
measurement. An exact matching observation takes precedence. When it is absent,
the largest compatible observation whose files are all still present supplies an
advisory floor. This retains known work after a file is added without summing
overlapping observations, borrowing another environment's cost, or interpreting
directory/glob selectors as complete files. A later exact measurement can lower
the estimate after an optimization.

These observations use the same independent-run sampling rules and apply only
after file splitting. They do not reconstruct a full parent or change the test
partition. Existing parent and exact-child timing keys retain their meaning.
Wrapper preparation is already included in each observation; the separate shared
runtime build is charged once per job. Unknown groups retain positive fallback
costs. Native evidence with the same inventory must verify latency, actual
resources and cleanup before claiming improvement.

`config/ci-test-timings.json` records CI measurements for UI and Gateway E2E files
and compact Node groups. UI and compact packers prefer these weights over their in-source cold-start
tables. UI E2E keys are repo-relative paths, including tests under `ui/src/pages/`,
and every file estimate includes the measured fork, import, and setup overhead.
Compact groups have separate Blacksmith and GitHub-hosted measurements, selected
from jobs API runner labels (`blacksmith-*` versus hosted `ubuntu-24.04`); hybrid
and large-group stripe adjustments continue to use their existing policies.
Compact weights use the complete `[shard:x] begin` to `end` span, preserving
process startup and any contention in the measured run. Ordinary Blacksmith compact jobs may execute two groups concurrently; serial
jobs retain `planConcurrency: 1`. The refit preserves each complete child span,
including contention, without subtracting setup or rewriting historical costs. Runner-profile
calibration remains a separate admission policy.

For split compact groups, the refit also records the parent cost from a complete
generation within one run and runner profile. It sums each part's median span,
takes the largest complete generation or direct parent measurement in that run,
and applies the same two-run minimum and median rules. The stable parent estimate
survives file additions and repartitioning, while exact child keys continue to
describe only their original inventory. Partial generations cannot create or
lower a parent estimate; observing a child preserves an existing parent during
pruning. Parts from different runs, profiles, or generations never form a total.

Gateway E2E uses the same greedy partition owner as UI E2E. Measured file durations
include suite hooks; new files use source bytes scaled by the discovered files'
measured seconds per byte. Without measurements, Gateway partitions use source
bytes alone. The CLI JSON suite is split by command family so its existing cases
can run across the four shards without an indivisible serial tail.

The compact plan is built once in preflight. E2E shards build their partitions
independently, so they must read the same committed file from the checkout. They
never download timing artifacts or consult restored timing caches. Missing or
invalid timing files, or `OPENCLAW_CI_TEST_TIMINGS=0`, use the cold-start estimates
for the entire file; stale keys cannot change the discovered test inventory.

With an authenticated `gh` CLI, run `pnpm ci:timings:refit` to regenerate the file.
Each invocation freezes one UTC upper bound and a lower bound seven days earlier.
Every run-list page uses both bounds. Returned run timestamps and successful job
timestamps outside that window fail validation.

The refit seeks up to five successful `ci.yml` push runs on `main` with parsed
compact measurements. Docs-only runs and unparseable logs do not fill that quota.
It also samples up to five successful manual runs of each release-check workflow
that owns Gateway E2E. Run searches remain bounded by 25 pages and GitHub's
1,000-result filtered-query limit. Incomplete pagination fails without writing.

For each selected run, the refit captures `run_attempt` and enumerates attempts
one through that value. It verifies each job's run ID, attempt and workflow SHA
before reading successful, completed jobs. This retains original successful jobs
when a partial retry runs only failed jobs. Duplicate run and job IDs do not add
samples. Ordinary manual CI dispatches remain excluded because their measured
target can differ from the workflow head. Release workflows validate their
selected target before tests. Their workflow SHA identifies tooling, not the
measured source.

Use `--runs <n>` to change the run quota, not the seven-day window.
Use `--repo <owner/repo>` to select a repository, `--out <path>` to write elsewhere,
or `--dry-run` to report changes without writing. The report separates main and
release observations, including run IDs, attempts, workflow SHAs, creation dates,
parsed profiles and timing-job counts.

Fewer than two independent main compact contributors fails the invocation.
It also fails if neither a compact key nor a runtime-placement observation meets the existing independent-run sampling rules.
Retained baseline weights and release measurements cannot satisfy these checks.
Both failures leave the timing file unchanged.
Measurements come only from successful UI E2E, Gateway E2E, and compact jobs; compact groups
also require an `exit 0` marker. Each entry needs at least two run samples;
multiple attempts within one run still contribute only one sample per key and
profile. Keys are pruned only when that profile has at least one observation in
each of at least three sampled runs, and only if the key is absent from every
contributing run. Profiles with fewer contributing runs retain all previous
keys; missing or unparseable logs do not count toward the threshold. Removals
remain explicit in the dry-run and PR change tables.
Samples above 2.5 times the key's median are discarded before taking the median,
and existing weights stay unchanged when the new median is within 15%. UI E2E
overhead is the median shard `(wall - body) / fileCount`, clamped to 0–5 seconds.

An empty `compactGroupSeconds.github` map is designed cold-start behavior:
main compact jobs normally run on Blacksmith, so the hosted profile keeps its
in-source `COMPACT_GITHUB_GROUP_SECONDS_HINTS` fallback until hosted observations
meet the sampling minimum. Later main attempts on the hybrid backend, or main
runs using `OPENCLAW_CI_RUNNER_BACKEND=github`, can fill it naturally. Once recorded,
hosted weights survive all-Blacksmith windows: pruning requires observations
from at least three hosted runs in the sampled window. Sampling stays main-only;
fork PR timings never influence the packer.

The `CI Test Timings Refit` workflow runs daily at 09:43 UTC and supports manual
dispatch on `main`. When weights change, it updates the single
`ci/test-timings-refit` branch and PR with sampled run IDs and the changed-entry
table. It never pushes to `main`; unchanged weights produce no commit or PR
update. The gitignored `.artifacts/vitest-shard-timings.json` remains a separate
whole-config timing cache for the local test-project runner, not an input to
these CI packers.

The shared generated-PR publisher refreshes `main` and rejects stale generator
inputs or overlapping timing-file changes before its leased branch push. It
uses separate repository-scoped GitHub App tokens for branch and PR writes;
the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN` has only contents-read permission. App-created
events trigger CI without the `GITHUB_TOKEN`-specific workflow approval step.
Normal repository review and required checks still apply; this workflow does
not enable auto-merge. See
[GitHub's workflow-trigger rules](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-when-workflows-run/trigger-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow).
